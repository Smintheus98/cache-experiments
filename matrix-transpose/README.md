# matrix-transpose

The transposition of a matrix is one of the simplest matrix algorithms, since every element of the transposed matrix can be independently calculated from a single value of the original matrix.
That makes this algorithm perfectly suitable to observe the different memory-access-pattern and their effect on the cache coherence.
